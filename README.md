# Automatic latent fingerprint identification system using scale and rotation invariant minutiae features



By Uttam U. Deshpande et al.,

To solve the problems of low minutiae features in the latent fingerprint regions, we generate minutiae invariants to uniqely identify the fingerprint. To address this, we propose two algorithms based on the minutiae neighborhood. To solve the geometrical constraints between the pairs of nearest points around a minutia, we propose the latent minutiae similarity (LMS) algorithm. Based on geometrical arrangements on the set of latent minutiae patterns around a minutia, we propose a clustered latent minutiae pattern (CLMP) algorithm.
